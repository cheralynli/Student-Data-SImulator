This program creates a grade school student data simulator where you can add students based on their grade. The program retrives the list of students in a specific grade and can also list the students of all grades.

Throught this code I have learnt the use of class, how to declare a class in .h and its implementations in .cpp. I have also learnt the use of const and &. Finally, I learnt how to use begin() and end() in assigning values to a map.
